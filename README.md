# Netflix-Database-schema
This project is a case study on the database management and application of Netflix, a subscription-based streaming service that allows its members to watch TV shows and movies on an internet-connected device. The project team, aimed to understand the database schema and design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using lucidchart to represent the database structure. The user requirements for Netflix were translated into business requirements, which include a seamless sign-up flow, easy login flow, multiple profiles, understanding of subscription plans, easy payment flow, and the ability to add items to a watchlist. The project also defines cardinality constraints, such as one user can sign up only once, and one user can login multiple times. The team also implemented a MySQL database to store the data and designed the database according to the requirements and constraints. The goal of Netflix is to entertain the world by providing best-in-class TV shows, documentaries, feature films, mobile games without any ads to users around the world.
